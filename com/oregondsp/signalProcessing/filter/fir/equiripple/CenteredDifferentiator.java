/**
 * Implements a centered equiripple differentiator - the point of symmetry falls on a sample.
 * 
 * <p>This class uses the Remez exchange algorithm to design a differentiator of length 2N+1.
 * The Nth sample (counting from 0) is zero, and the impulse response is an anti-symmetric 
 * sequence about this point.  The filter is linear phase, with group delay a constant equal 
 * to N.  The design parameters are the order (N) specifying the number (N+1) of approximating 
 * functions in the Remez algorithm, the intended sampling interval of the data and the passband 
 * edge frequency OmegaP.  The design problem is performed on a discrete-time frequency axis 
 * normalized to range between 0 and 1 (the folding frequency).  OmegaP, the upper band edge of 
 * the passband must be strictly less than 1, and should be in the range 0.8 - 0.95, depending 
 * on the specified order.  The larger the order, the closer OmegaP can be to 1.0 and yield an 
 * acceptable approximation.  For details on the design algorithm and characteristics of the filter 
 * response, see</p>
