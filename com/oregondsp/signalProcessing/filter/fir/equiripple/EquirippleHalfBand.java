/**
 * Designs a half-band FIR equiripple filter using the "half-band trick" and the Remez algorithm.
 * 
 * <p>This class designs a half-band filter (a filter suitable for interpolating data by a factor of 2).
 * It uses the "half-band trick" described in </p>
 * 
 * <p>A “TRICK” for the Design of FIR Half-Band Filters, P. P. VAIDYANATHAN AND TRUONG Q. NGUYEN (1987),
 * IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS, VOL. CAS-34, NO. 3, pp. 297-300.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The filter is obtained as a transformation of a EquirippleHalfBandPrototype, which is designed
 * with the Remez exchange algorithm.  As with other filters, the prototype is specified by a design
 * order parameter (N) and a band edge parameter (OmegaP).  The resulting FIR filter has 2N+1 coefficients
 * and is evenly symmetric about coefficient N, counting from 0.  The band edge parameter should be close
 * to 0.5, though slightly less: 0 < OmegaP < 0.5.  A value of 0.45 is reasonable, and the closer OmegaP
 * is to 0.5, the larger N must be to obtain a reasonable response.</p>
