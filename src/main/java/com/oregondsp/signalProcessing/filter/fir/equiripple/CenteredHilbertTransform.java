/**
 * Implements a centered equiripple Hilbert transform operator - the point of symmetry falls on a sample.
 * 
 * <p>This class uses the Remez exchange algorithm to design a Hilbert transformer of length 2N+1.
 * The Nth sample is zero (counting from 0), and the impulse response is an anti-symmetric sequence 
 * about this point.  The filter is linear phase, with group delay a constant equal to N.  The 
 * design parameters are the order (N) specifying the number (N+1) of approximating functions in the 
 * Remez algorithm, and two parameters specifying the band edge frequencies.  The design problem 
 * is performed on a discrete-time frequency axis normalized to range between 0 and 1 (the folding 
 * frequency).  Omega1, the lower band edge of the passband must be greater than 0 and less than
 * Omega2, the upper band edge.  Omega2 must be strictly less than 1.  A tradeoff exists between the 
 * filter order N and band edge frequencies.  As Omega1 approaches 0 or Omega2 approaches 1, the order
 * must be increased to obtain an acceptable design.</p>
